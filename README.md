## Overview

This library allows easy access to IBM Cloud services configuration data for services that have been bound to a Spring Boot application.

Including the dependency `ibm-cloud-spring-boot-service-bind` auto configures a <code>PropertySource</code> to allow service configuration using Spring property source mechanisms such as <code>@Value</code> annotations, <code>Environment</code> objects, etc.

Multiple runtime environments are supported such as:  

- IBM Cloud - Kubernetes
- IBM Cloud - Cloud Foundry
- local / on prem - access to IBM Cloud hosted services

The supported methods of binding a service to your application are:  
   
* IBM Cloud App Services console
* IBM Cloud Developer Tools CLI
* Manual Binding

## Usage

Dependency configuration:

**Maven:**

```xml
<dependency>
   <groupId>com.ibm.cloud</groupId>
   <artifactId>ibm-cloud-spring-boot-service-bind</artifactId>
   <version>1.1.2</version>
</dependency>
```

**Gradle:**

```groovy
dependencies {
    compile group: 'com.ibm.cloud', name: 'ibm-cloud-spring-boot-service-bind', version: '1.1.2'
}
```

To access service configuration in your code you can use the <code>@Value</code> annotation, or use the Spring framework `Environment` class' <code>getProperty()</code> method. 

**Example:** Accessing configuration data for an IBM Cloudant NoSQL DB service:

~~~ java
     @Autowired
     Environment env; 

     @Value("cloudant.url")
     String cloudantUrl;

     String cloudantUsername = 
          env.getProperty("cloudant.username");
~~~

## Binding IBM Cloud Services to a Spring Boot Application

Your application must be bound to an IBM Cloud service in order to use this library. The following methods of service binding are supported:

1. IBM Cloud App Services Console  

   You can use the [IBM Cloud App Services Console](https://console.bluemix.net/developer/appservice/dashboard) to create Spring Boot apps, create services, and bind the services to apps.
2. IBM Cloud Developer Tools CLI  

   You can also use the [IBM Cloud Developer Tools CLI](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/cloudnative/idt/index.html#developercli) to create a Spring Boot app, create services, and bind the services to the app.
3. Manually create an IBM Cloud service and add the configuration values to the `application.properties` file.  

   For example, from the [IBM Cloud Services Catalg](https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/) select the [Cloudant NoSQL DB](https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/services/cloudant-nosql-db) service and click Create to create a  Cloudant service.</p>  

   On the Service Credentials tab of the service select the View Credentials drop down and copy the `username`, `password`, and `url` values to your app's `application.properties` file as follows:  

   ~~~ properties
   cloudant.username=62c520dc-9367...  
   cloudant.password=8c03bd171cd99...
   cloudant.url=https://62c520dc-9367...cloudant.com
   ~~~  
 
 
Additionally, the generated `mappings.json` file will be used to define search parameters for discovering credentials for 
services. See the IBM Cloud Env [readme](https://github.com/ibm-developer/ibm-cloud-env) for more information about this file.
